# Game Site

This is a site I made to practice the basics of frontend web development, i.e. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This site contains six games, namely:

1. Rock-Paper-Scissors
2. Memory Game
3. Breakout
4. Whac-a-Mole
5. Snake
6. Space Invaders

## Set Up

Download the repository into a local folder, and open up index.html in a browser to begin using the site.

## Games

### Rock-Paper-Scissors

Click on the option that you want. A choice will be selected at random by the computer and it will display who won that round.

### Memory Game

An image will be shown once you click on a card. Match the cards to win.

### Breakout

Classic Breakout game - break all the bricks to win. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the base board.

### Whac-a-Mole

Click on start to begin the game. The game will last 30 seconds, and a mole will spawn randomly in a random square. Click on the square with the mole to score a point.

### Snake

Use arrow keys to control the snake and eat the green food to grow the snake by one unit. Avoid the red food as it will cause you to shrink by one unit. The game is over when you reach a length of one unit, collide with the edges of the game, or collide with yourself.

### Space Invaders

Use the left and right arrow keys to move the cannon, and spacebar to shoot. Destroy all the aliens before they reach you. The game is over once you collide with the aliens or if the aliens reach the bottom edge of the game.
